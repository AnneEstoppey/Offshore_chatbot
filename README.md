# Offshore chatbot ðŸ¤–

We are exploring the possibility to build a chatbot with an open source Large Language Model, locally on a 'every day' laptop (no GPU). Ultimately, we would like to 'fine-tune' the chatbot with extra public data, related to the energy industry on the continental shelf of Norway. 

## Steps

1) Create the chatbot and test it on local - DONE
2) Add extra data (public) for fine-tuning for offshore activities on Norwegian continental shelf - under construction

## Install - requirements
We installed a brand new Python environment from conda, Python version: **3.11.3**

We installed all the following libraries from PIP (at the time of creating the chatbot, we didn't succeed to install the 'llama' libraries from conda!)
- langchain
- llama-index
- llama-index-llms-llama-cpp
- llama-cpp-python
- streamlit

**NOTE**: if you are using Windows, you will have to install Visual Studio Installer, and then install the Desktop development with C++, in order to be able to install and use the python libraries related to 'llama-ccp'.

## Data source
LLM:
Huggingface language model (7 billion parameters): llama-2-7b-chat.Q2_K.gguf (size: 2.7 GB)

--> please check in the references below as we have not included this model in this repo, you will have to download it from huggingface.

## Example - first run!
This is a first try to interact with the chatbot, directly towards the LLM, NO fine-tuning... Some facts are not exactly correct, but not too bad for a model of that size, working locally from my laptop!
